## File Details
    
### /shared-resources/resources/testResourceNames.sh
This Bash script checks and adjusts Azure resource group names based on deployment type and ensures they do not exceed character limits. It handles different deployment types (ev2 or others), retrieves parameters from specific JSON files, and builds resource group names according to Azure's naming restrictions. It also validates the length of the generated names to prevent deployment failures.

### /shared-resources/resources/template-Main.SharedResources.Parameters.json
This document is a JSON parameter file for an Azure deployment template. It includes parameters such as resourcesName, subscriptionId, location, and resourceGroupName, which are placeholders for values to be filled in during deployment.

### /shared-resources/resources/Main.SharedResources.Template.bicep
This Bicep template is designed for deploying various Azure resources at the subscription scope. It includes modules for deploying a resource group, an AKS-managed cluster, a container registry, an operational insights workspace, a data collection rule, and a service bus namespace. Parameters include resource names, subscription ID, location, and resource group name. The template is not generated and is part of a larger repository structure.
