## File Details
    
### /shared-resources/deleteResourceGroup.sh
This is a bash script designed to delete an Azure resource group. The script takes a resource name as a parameter, navigates to the 'shared-resources' directory, and attempts to delete a resource group named 'servicehubval-<resourceName>-rg'. It provides feedback on whether the deletion was successful or not using colored output in the terminal.

### /shared-resources/provisionSharedResourcesPipeline.yaml
This YAML file defines a pipeline for provisioning shared resources using Azure CLI and Bash scripts. It includes steps to deploy shared resources, log the resource group link, and publish markdown files related to shared resources.

### /shared-resources/provisionSharedResources.sh
This Bash script is designed to provision shared resources by navigating to the 'shared-resources' directory and executing 'make deploy-resources'. It checks if the deployment was successful, indicating success with a green message and failure with a red message. The script currently has a hard-coded folder name, with a note to improve this by using a template from 'resources-config.yaml'.

### /shared-resources/Makefile
The Makefile in the './binded-data/shared-resources/' directory automates the process of generating template files and deploying resources using Azure CLI and Docker. It uses environment configurations and Docker images to execute template generation and resource provisioning commands.

### /shared-resources/.state.txt
The document is a text file that lists various paths and file names related to shared resources and configurations, likely part of a larger project or repository. This includes configuration files, parameter files, templates, and scripts for provisioning and managing resources.

### /shared-resources/OneBranch.Official.Release.yml
This YAML configuration file is for the OneBranch Pipelines, specifically for managing the release process. It includes parameters for rollout types, validation duration, and incident IDs. The file specifies resources such as repositories and pipelines, and extends a template for managing SDP rollouts in a production environment. It also defines a stage for managed SDP with specific job and task configurations for artifact downloading and rollout.
