## File Details
    
### /pipeline-files/OneBranch.Official.Release.Example.yml
This YAML configuration file is part of the OneBranch Pipelines, designed to manage rollout processes for software deployments. It includes parameters for rollout types, validation durations, and incident management. The file specifies resources, including a templates repository and a build pipeline for artifacts. It extends a template for cross-platform operations and defines a production stage for managed SDP rollouts, utilizing specific tasks and steps for deployment.

### /pipeline-files/buildEv2Artifacts.sh
This shell script, buildEv2Artifacts.sh, is used to create artifact files for a service or shared resources. It handles directory navigation, testing, building Docker images, packaging Helm charts, and copying necessary files to an output directory. The script takes six parameters: directoryName, outputDir, isService, rolloutInfra, buildNumber, and isLocal. It also manages dependencies such as Helm and Crane for container registry operations.

### /pipeline-files/OneBranch.Official.Build.yml
This YAML file is a build pipeline configuration for OneBranch, designed to be used across various services or shared resources with a specific directory structure. It includes variables for directory name, service type, and infrastructure rollout. The pipeline is structured into stages, such as 'createArtifactsFiles' and 'combineArtifacts', with conditional job execution based on the 'isService' variable. It uses Docker for building and includes tasks for downloading and preparing artifacts. The file extends a template from a specified repository and includes links to documentation and support.

### /pipeline-files/.state.txt
This document lists various pipeline and script files related to build and release processes. It includes YAML files for build and release configurations and shell scripts for artifact creation and requirements download.

### /pipeline-files/testServiceResourceAndCode.yaml
This YAML file defines a pipeline for creating, deploying, and deleting resources in a cloud environment using Azure DevOps. It includes two main stages: a creation stage that generates environment configurations, publishes them as artifacts, and provisions shared resources, and a deletion stage that deletes the resources if a specified condition is met. The pipeline utilizes Bash scripts and Azure CLI tasks for its operations.

### /pipeline-files/downloadRequirements.yaml
This YAML configuration file specifies a step in a pipeline to download an environment configuration artifact named 'EnvConfig' to the system's default working directory.
